If you can't do as much with const as you can with let, why would you prefer to use it rather than let? 
In fact const is very useful. If you use const to name a value, it tells anyone looking at your code that this name will never be assigned to a different value. 
Any time they see this name, they will know what it refers to.

In this course, we adopt the following principle about when to use let and when to use const:

*Use const when you can, and use let when you have to.

This means that if you can initialize a variable when you declare it, and don't need to reassign it later, make it a constant.
